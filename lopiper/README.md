TODO:
- [ ] Make new generic library/crate utils.
- [ ] Go throw lexer
- [ ] go through utils
- [ ] go through parser
- [ ] don't overoptimize lexer and parser because they don't run often
- [ ] Unit test for every time

- [ ] String::from("blah") or "blah".to_string()?
- [ ] for stack trace, need to implement lambda to work better with define'd names
- [ ] fix quotes for '(+ 3 5) (currently quotes only work for stuff like 'sdf)
